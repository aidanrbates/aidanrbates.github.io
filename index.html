                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <p>The Ethics in Action conference is a space for curious and critical minds to engage with what ethics means to them personally, as a society, and how we can incorporate ethics into our daily lives.

                    Our key question is: “<strong>How do we create the world we wish to live in?</strong>” We ask this question because we want to look at both <strong>ethical theory</strong>, where ideas emerge, and <strong>action</strong>, which puts those ideas into practice.

 The conference will consist of speakers, a symposium, and workshops. Students, faculty, grassroots activists and community members are invited to present on their particular ethical inquiries and practices.

We hope that through collaboration and discourse, participants may feel empowered as ethical agents to act collaboratively in order create the world they wish to live in.

                    <p>Sarah is an Evergreen Alum of ‘01, and is currently getting her PhD at the University of British
                        Columbia in History. Sarah is an environmental historian with a focus in folklore, and has spent
                        over the past 10 years recording the lived experiences of Downwinders, those who live in areas 
                        downwind of nuclear production sites. Her book Downwind: A People’s History of the Nuclear West 
                        focuses on the lived experiences of those who are impacted by radiological exposure in the Great 
                        Basin. Her work seeks to center the expertise of ordinary people living in impacted regions, whose 
                        voices and knowledge are often excluded from the historical record. </p>

                    <h2>Eirik Steinhoff</h2>
                    <p>Eirik Steinhoff has worked as a visiting member of the faculty at The Evergreen State College since 2013. He teaches and co-teaches intensive interdisciplinary programs with titles like, “How to do things with words,” “Forensics,” “A New Middle East,” “Words/Woods,” and currently “Gateways for Incarcerated Youth: Critical Literacy + Critical Numeracy.” He has also taught Shakespeare, critical theory, rhetoric, poetry, and poetics at the University of Chicago (where he received his Ph.D. in English), Bard College (where he received his B.A.), and Mills College. In the early 21st century, he edited Chicago Review, and in 2009 his translations from Petrarch’s Rime Sparse appeared as Fourteen Sonnets from Albion Books. In 2010, he taught at Green Haven Correctional Facility under the auspices of the Bard Prison Initiative, and in 2014 he co-facilitated a weeklong reading and writing seminar with faculty at Al-Quds University in Palestine.</p>
                    <p>A series of pamphlets he curated in late 2011 and early 2012, called A Fiery Flying Roule, has just been published in book form with a 60-page afterword. He co-edits Black Box: A Record of the Catastrophe, and his essays have appeared in Arcade, Chicago Review, Counter-Signals, Floor, postmedieval, and elsewhere. He works with incarcerated teachers and students in collaboration with the Black Prisoner Caucus’s T.E.A.C.H. program (“Taking Education and Creating History”). The bulk of his study in the classroom and beyond revolves around the question, “What needs to be the case for things to be otherwise?”

                    <h2 class="subdesc">Together, we can pull ethics out of abstraction, find examples of how to act ethically, and attempt to answer our 
                        central question: how do I create the world I wish to live in? In the pre-seminars, we will challenge ourselves to address this 
                        question by drawing on past and present work to create projects that will shape our future.  During the conference, we will gather in 
                        a group symposium, small group workshops, seminars and displays of art and informative posters</h2>
