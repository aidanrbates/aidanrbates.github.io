                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <p>The Ethics in Action conference wishes to generate a space within which participants can engage with the bridge between                    ethics and action, theory and practice. These two ideas have often been separated, where ethics remains in the world                      of academics, and action has belonged to activists. This conference seeks to reclaim ethics, and place it within its                      active domain of ethical action, where theory and practice no longer remain isolated, but naturally evolve into praxis.                   The Ethics in Action conference is a networking ground for inspiration, bringing curious and critical minds together who                    are interested in bridging the gap, or who are already engaging in such praxis.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The conference will consist of a keynote speaker, symposium, and breakout sessions which will include workshops and                       seminars. Students, faculty, grassroots activists and community members are invited to present on their particular                         ethical inquiries and practices. Participants will have access to both ethical theory and insight into the ethos of                        activism and organizing. We all have something to learn from one another, and this conference seeks to create that                       learning space!
                </p>
                  <p>
                    Ethics begs the question of how to live, action generates the movement to create a different tomorrow.                                  We hope that our participants can narrow towards a realization of this deeply personal question of how to live. And                        furthermore, we hope that through collaboration and discourse, participants may feel empowered as ethical agents to act                      collaboratively in order create the world they wish to live in.
